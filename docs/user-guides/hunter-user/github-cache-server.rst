.. _uploading to server:

Using GitHub repository as binary cache server
----------------------------------------------

It is possible to upload Hunter binary cache to the server.
Next shown an example of using GitHub as a hosting. All big raw ``*.tar.bz2`` archives
uploaded as assets to release with names ``cache-*`` (directory layout does not
matter) and all small text files with meta information uploaded directly to
branch ``master`` (directory layout matters) (see
`hunter-cache <https://github.com/ingenue/hunter-cache>`__ as example).

.. note::

  If you have shared folder in your network there is no need to use
  any scripts, you can just set ``HUNTER_ROOT`` variable to location of this
  directory.

.. note::

  Currently upload procedure is implemented using Python script with
  ``requests`` module, check that you have Python installed in your system.
  This limitation will be removed in future. Downloading from server done by
  ``file(DOWNLOAD ...)`` CMake commands, so client is still CMake-only based.

Example
~~~~~~~

Next example will show how to setup GitHub binary cache server:

* https://github.com/forexample/hunter-cache

Which will be managed by bot account:

* https://github.com/ingenue

Cache will be uploaded for CI jobs in repository:

* https://github.com/forexample/hunter-cache-use

Diagram:

.. image:: images/upload.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Upload diagram

Workflow:

* Users push code to ``hunter-cache-use`` repository
* ``hunter-cache-use`` CI configs hold encrypted token
* When encrypted token reach CI, CI knows how to decrypt it
* Using decrypted token CI can act on bot behalf and upload binaries
* Binaries can be reused by anybody who have added ``hunter-cache`` to the
  ``HUNTER_CACHE_SERVERS``

Setup
~~~~~

Direction of setup procedure is inversed:

* Create cache server
* Create bot account
* Create token
* Give bot write access to cache server
* Encrypt token
* Save token in CI configs

Create cache server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create repository with at least one file:

.. image:: images/create-server.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Create server

Note that if repository will be empty it will not be possible to create tags
for assets.

Create bot token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Login to GitHub with the **bot** account, in our case it's ``ingenue``:

.. image:: images/ingenue-login.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Login

:menuselection:`Settings --> Developer settings --> Personal access tokens --> Generate new token`:

.. image:: images/ingenue-token.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Token

Set ``public_repo`` check-box and create token:

.. image:: images/ingenue-public-repo.png
  :align: center
  :alt: public_repo

.. note::

  Keep you token private! It's the same as your password!

.. seealso::

  * `GitHub: creating token <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/>`__

Access
~~~~~~

Add ``ingenue`` bot as a collaborator to ``hunter-cache``:

.. image:: images/hunter-cache-collaborator.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Collaborator

.. note::

  Bot doesn't interact with ``hunter-cache-use`` so there is no need
  to set any permissions there.

You should receive email about invitation. Login as **bot** and accept it:

.. image:: images/accept-invitation.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Invitation

Travis CI
~~~~~~~~~

Now we will save token as a secured environment variable
``GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD`` in Travis and AppVeyor.

.. note::

  Visit https://travis-ci.org and register ``hunter-cache-use`` repository
  there.

Excerpts from documentation (`1 <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys>`__
and `2 <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables>`__)
for OS X  (see also `this repo <https://github.com/forexample/github-binary-release>`__):

.. code-block:: none

  > gem install travis # for Ubuntu it will be 'sudo gem install travis'

If you have problems with installing ``travis`` try to install
`ruby from brew <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31972968/cant-install-gems-on-os-x-el-capitan>`__:

.. code-block:: none

  > brew install ruby

Login with account with which you have registered repository for CI.
In my case it's my personal account ``ruslo``:

.. image:: images/travis-owner.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Travis owner

Login with ``ruslo`` (add ``--pro`` if repository is private):

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 1, 8-10, 13-14

  > travis login
  We need your GitHub login to identify you.
  This information will not be sent to Travis CI, only to api.github.com.
  The password will not be displayed.

  Try running with --github-token or --auto if you don't want to enter your password anyway.

  Username: ruslo
  Password for ruslo: xxxxxx
  Two-factor authentication code for ruslo: xxxxxx
  Successfully logged in as ruslo!

  > travis whoami
  You are ruslo (Ruslan Baratov)

Encrypt token:

.. code-block:: none
  :emphasize-lines: 1, 4

  > travis encrypt -r forexample/hunter-cache-use GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD=62xxxxxx2e
  Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:

    secure: "EWdxxxxxxfkk="

  Pro Tip: You can add it automatically by running with --add.

And add it to ``.travis.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  env:
    global:
      - secure: "EWdxxxxxxfkk="

.. seealso::

  * `.travis.yml example <https://github.com/forexample/hunter-cache-use/blob/5b502a2a982d0e0de318e8789a50444b5f6dba2c/.travis.yml#L22-L24>`__

AppVeyor
~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  Visit https://appveyor.com and register ``hunter-cache-use`` repository
  there.

.. note::

  You may want to turn on feature:

  * ``Enable secure variables in Pull Requests from the same repository only``

Login with account with which you have registered repository for CI.
In my case it's my personal account ``ruslo``:

.. image:: images/appveyor-add.png
  :align: center
  :alt: AppVeyor add

While being logged in with the same account use
`this form <https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt>`__ to encrypt bot token:

.. image:: images/appveyor-encrypt.png
  :align: center
  :alt: AppVeyor login

Add it to the ``appveyor.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  environment:
    global:
      GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD:
        secure: Ze5xxxxxxObq

.. seealso::

  * `appveyor.yml example <https://github.com/forexample/hunter-cache-use/blob/5b502a2a982d0e0de318e8789a50444b5f6dba2c/appveyor.yml#L3-L6>`__

CMake code
~~~~~~~~~~

CI systems are ready, now let's do CMake code.

.. note::

  CMake variables for Hunter should be set to cache before HunterGate, see

  * :doc:`Hunter: User variables </reference/user-variables>`

:ref:`HUNTER_CACHE_SERVERS <hunter_cache_servers>` is a list of servers we will
use to **download** binaries. We need only one server
``https://github.com/forexample/hunter-cache``:

.. code-block:: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 2-3

  set(
      HUNTER_CACHE_SERVERS
      "https://github.com/forexample/hunter-cache"
      CACHE
      STRING
      "Default cache server"
  )

We want :ref:`HUNTER_RUN_UPLOAD <hunter_run_upload>` to be set to ``ON`` by
default only when it's a CI server and secured variable
``GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD``
is defined. In practice it means:

* Upload will be triggered when new commit pushed to branch
* Upload will be triggered when pull request opened basing on branch
  **of the same repository**
* Upload will not be available when pull request opened basing on branch
  from **another repository**
* If ``GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD`` environment variable defined on local machine
  there will be no upload by default
* If ``GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD`` environment variable defined on local machine
  and ``HUNTER_RUN_UPLOAD=ON`` **added by user** upload will happen

.. code-block:: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 6

  string(COMPARE EQUAL "$ENV{TRAVIS}" "true" is_travis)
  string(COMPARE EQUAL "$ENV{APPVEYOR}" "True" is_appveyor)
  string(COMPARE EQUAL "$ENV{GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD}" "" password_is_empty)

  if((is_travis OR is_appveyor) AND NOT password_is_empty)
    option(HUNTER_RUN_UPLOAD "Upload cache binaries" ON)
  endif()

File with passwords:

.. code-block:: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 3

  set(
      HUNTER_PASSWORDS_PATH
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/cmake/Hunter/passwords.cmake"
      CACHE
      FILEPATH
      "Hunter passwords"
  )

There will be no real passwords there, only configuration
for repositories and instruction to read password from environment variable
``GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD``:

.. code-block:: cmake
  :emphasize-lines: 5-6, 9, 12

  # cmake/Hunter/passwords.cmake

  hunter_upload_password(
      # REPO_OWNER + REPO = https://github.com/forexample/hunter-cache
      REPO_OWNER "forexample"
      REPO "hunter-cache"

      # USERNAME = https://github.com/ingenue
      USERNAME "ingenue"

      # PASSWORD = GitHub token saved as a secure environment variable
      PASSWORD "$ENV{GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD}"
  )
