Update package
--------------

Create branch for working on package update:

.. code-block:: none

  [hunter]> git checkout master
  [hunter]> git checkout -b pr.hunter_box_1

Calculate SHA1 of release:

.. code-block:: none

  > wget https://github.com/hunterbox/hunter_box_1/archive/v1.0.1.tar.gz
  > openssl sha1 v1.0.1.tar.gz
  SHA1(v1.0.1.tar.gz)= 10d046eec6c8b0aabd28bd3d1b99faf6beeb226b

Add URL and SHA1 to corresponding ``hunter.cmake``:

.. literalinclude:: hunter-NEW.cmake
  :diff: hunter.cmake

.. hint::

  Put new ``hunter_add_version`` at the bottom of file, diff will look
  prettier in this case.

Update default version in ``cmake/configs/default.cmake``:

.. literalinclude:: default-NEW.cmake
  :diff: default.cmake

Commit changes:

.. code-block:: none

  [hunter]> git add cmake/projects/hunter_box_1/hunter.cmake
  [hunter]> git add cmake/configs/default.cmake
  [hunter]> git commit -m "Update 'hunter_box_1' to v1.0.1"

Testing
=======

.. note::

  Check :ref:`Create package: CI testing <ci testing>` page for registering
  services and branches/remotes description.

Fetch latest CI configs, you may need to run ``git pull`` if you have
``pkg.hunter_box_1`` locally:

.. code-block:: none

  [hunter]> git fetch ci
  [hunter]> git checkout pkg.hunter_box_1
  [hunter]> git pull

If the package has not been updated in some time, the CI toolchains 
may have fallen out of date.  It is preferable to keep the CI 
configuration in sync with the working defaults from ``pkg.template`` 
to make sure the package will build with recent compilers and to help 
ensure cache hits for any required Hunter managed dependencies. 

.. code-block:: none
  
  [hunter]> git checkout pkg.template
  [hunter]> git pull
  [hunter]> git checkout pkg.hunter_box_1
  [hunter]> git merge pkg.template

Create temporary branch ``test.hunter_box_1`` for testing basing on
``pkg.hunter_box_1``:

.. code-block:: none

  [hunter]> git checkout -b test.hunter_box_1

Merge it with ``hunter_box_1`` package updates:

.. code-block:: none

  [hunter]> git merge pr.hunter_box_1

Push changes to your Hunter fork remote to start tests:

.. code-block:: none

  [hunter]> git push -u origin test.hunter_box_1

Add toolchains
==============

If new version of package fix some build:

* Add new version to ``master``
* Tests against **old** set of toolchains
* New version merged to master
* Send pull request to ``pkg.hunter_box_1`` to enable **new** toolchains

Remove toolchains
=================

If new version broke some toolchain:

* Disable toolchains in ``pkg.hunter_box_1``
* Add new version to ``master``
* Tests against **new** set of toolchains without broken

Submit the pull request to Hunter
=================================

Once the tests are passing, and all required toolchain modifications have been applied to the ``ci`` fork in ``pkg.hunter_box_1`` via pull requests (see above), the original package update in ``pr.hunter_box_1`` should then be pushed to your Hunter fork (``origin`` in above discussions):

.. code-block:: none
    
    [hunter]> git push -u origin pr.hunter_box_1

Finally, a pull request should be opened to send the package update to the main Hunter repository, as illustrated in the previous section pull request `screen shot <https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/creating-new/create/cmake.html#pull-requests>`__.
