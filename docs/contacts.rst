  to share, do use public channels otherwise.

- Please do not cross-post. Do not send the same messages to all channels.

- Please avoid adding messages to closed issues unless it's absolutely
  necessary. If the issue is closed then it means that problem was resolved
  for original author or author lost interest in it. Please report a new issue
  with your details and fresh setup instead.

  "+1", "me too!", "any updates?!", "please please fix it!", etc.
